# Telnet
- Telnet (short for TErminal NETwork) is a network protocol used to provide a command line interface for communicating with a device.

Telnet is used most often for remote management but also sometimes for the initial setup for some devices, especially network hardware like switches, access points, etc
Managing files on a website is also something Telnet is sometimes used for.

## How Does Telnet Work?
Telnet used to be used mainly on a terminal, or a "dumb" computer. These computers require only a keyboard because everything on the screen is displayed as text. There is no graphical user interface like you see with modern computers and operating systems.

The terminal provides a way to remotely log on to another device, just as if you were sitting in front of it and using it like any other computer. This method of communication is of course done via Telnet.

Nowadays, Telnet can be used from a virtual terminal, or a terminal emulator, which is essentially a modern computer that communicates with the same Telnet protocol.

One example of this is the Telnet command, available from within the Command Prompt in Windows. The telnet command, unsurprisingly, is a command that uses the Telnet protocol to communicate with a remote device or system.

Telnet commands can also be executed on other operating systems like Linux, Mac, and Unix, much in the same was as you would in Windows.

Telnet is not the same thing as other TCP/IP protocols like HTTP, which just let you transfer files to and from a server. Instead, the Telnet protocol has you log on to a server as if you were an actual user, granting you direct control and all the same rights to files and applications as the user that you're logged in as.
